Once upon a time,
In a land far away,
The queen ruled over her kingdom with
A mysterious shadow appeared
Technology has changed the way we
The ancient library contained secrets
She opened the door and saw
The sun was setting when
A young wizard discovered
The prophecy foretold
Long ago in a distant kingdom
The treasure was hidden
A brave knight ventured
The storm was approaching
In the depths of the forest
The magic spell was cast
A forgotten city lay
The old book revealed
