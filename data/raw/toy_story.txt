Once upon a time in a city of pocket-sized narrators, lampposts told bedtime stories.
People carried jars to catch whispers of tales before dawn.
One evening, a curious child asked, "What happens when stories run out?"
The lamppost flickered and said, "Then you write the next one."
From that night on, stories never ended; they simply changed authors.
