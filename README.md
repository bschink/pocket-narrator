## Overview

This project is a systematic investigation into the architecture and components of small language models for efficient narrative generation. Our primary goal is to develop a deep understanding of the trade-offs between different architectural choices in terms of performance, computational efficiency and output quality, rather than simply building a model that can generate stories.

To achieve this, we will implement language models from scratch using PyTorch. The project will be centered around the [TinyStories dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories), a clean, restricted-domain dataset ideal for training capable small models without requiring massive computational resources. One thing to note: This dataset contains a collection of short children stories which we will make use of to build a simple language model with the goal of completing sentences (next token prediction). Firstly, we aim to replicate and optimise the paper corresponding to the dataset [TinyStories: How Small Can Language Models Be and Still Speak Coherent English?](https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.07759) (Eldan, et al.) by using the Transformer architecture proposed in [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762) (Vaswani, et al.). If time permits, we will compare the Transformer architecture with Mamba, a state-space model proposed in [Mamba: Linear-Time Sequence Modeling with Selective State Spaces](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.00752) (Gu, et al.).
